# Tablet
### Tablet keeps track of all your personal connections, hassle and distraction free. 

Have you ever:
- met someone and wish to keep in touch, but didn't end up remembering to do so?
- gotten sick of the 1000+ LinkedIn connection requests, where you don't know half of them?
- thought of someone who's helped you and wish to pay back, but couldn't remember how you met them?
- wanted to introduce someone, and ended up having to go through a myriad of social platforms to find their contacts?

### Solution: Simply add a few quick notes to preserve the memory. We'll link them to each of your contacts.
